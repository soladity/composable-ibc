# Hyperspace Relayer


Rust implementation of the IBC relayer algorithm.

### Goals

 ✅ Event driven architecture.
 <br />
 ✅ Fully stateless with no caching, and instead relies on full nodes for data storage as a source of truth.
  <br />
 ✅ Chain agnostic, so it can be extended to support new chains with little no changes to the core framework.


Named after a fictional technology in starwars for [relaying deep space messages](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperspace_relay).
